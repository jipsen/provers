Prover9
=======

A small python library to access Prover9 from a Jupyter notebook.

E.g. to use this in https://colab.research.google.com just run the following two lines in a code cell:

```
!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jipsen/provers/refs/heads/master/LoadProver9.py
%run LoadProver9.py
```
